        /*The program runs a loop where the variable starts at the numeric value of 1. The loop is set so that each line adds 1 to the previous value until it stops at 100. The sequence of the code then goes onto selection where conditionals are set. If the produced value was divisible by 3, the console replaced the number with the word "Fizz" and then if the value was divisible by 5, then the value was replaced with "Buzz." Otherwise, the values that aren't divisible by 3 or 5 will remain unchanged. */
