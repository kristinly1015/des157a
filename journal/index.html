        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-23">October 23rd, 2023</time>
        <p>The article, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>, helps encourage readers to practice and develop their visual thinking skills. First you would need to create something that is visually appealing yet leaves viewers curious for more. You should also be practicing regularly by observing pictures without knowing the context and seeing if you can point out the smaller details. It also helps to ask questions and share your thoughts with other peers. This improves self reading and allows more ideas to flow in as you build on others' ideas. Lastly, you can expand your knowledge and start conversations, as well as introduce new ideas.</p>        
        
        <p>A website that inspires visual thinking is <a href= "https://www.awwwards.com/sites/engaged">Engaged</a>. The site uses interactive elements that engage the user into reading what the site has to offer. It utilizes cool effects such as a vortex transition, smooth scrolling, and visual textures across the page. It hooks the viewer in with aesthetically pleasing visuals which then encourages them to read more into the information.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Overlays</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-18">October 18th, 2023</time>

        <p>The article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Overlays</a>, discusses the uses and techniques for modal windows or overlays. I learned that overlays can be used to either show additional information, grab the user's attention, or if you need user input. This is something I never thought about whenever I saw an overlay on a website since it just seemed intuitive. In terms of design characteristics for an overlay, you should always include an escape hatch. This includes a 'cancel' or 'close' button, an escape key, or a feature that allows the user to click out of the window in order to close the overlay. An overlay should also include a title and a main button for submission. What is necessary to consider is the sizing of the overlay, which should be small so that it doesn't take over the whole page, and a focus-feature to highlight the overlay and guide the user's eye.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-12">October 12th, 2023</time>

        <p>The article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, lists a set of guidelines that every product designer should keep in mind when it comes to creating forms. It emphasizes on small details within form layouts that create a big difference for the user experience. For example, characteristics such as type length, text box size, legibility, and coloring all have to be considered when making a form</p>

        <p>One important thing I learned from the article is to reduce cognitive load on a form. This means to simplify any text and visual clutter so that the user does not get overwhelmed with the information on the page. This also takes into account inserting the more simple questions at the beginning of the form and leaving the harder questions for last. If you make the user feel like the form will be too much to work on, then they won't bother filling it out to begin with.</p>
            
        <p>Another thing I thought was useful was keeping any labels or instructions outside of the input fields. Inserting labels within the text fields would only disappear once the user clicks on the box to fill out. This makes it more confusing if the user forgets what they're supposed to be inputting into the form. This is definitely something that I didn't realize would be much of an issue until it was explained to me.</p>

        <p>I think a website that uses efficient form practices is <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/get-started/">Betterhelp</a>. The site provides a smooth questionnaire process by allowing the user to pick from simple options from small lists and checkboxes. The questions also go in the order from from easiest to hardest, which reduces cognitive load.</p>
