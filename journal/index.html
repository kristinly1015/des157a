        <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-11-06">November 6th, 2023</time>
        <p>The article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a>, teaches the best UX techniques to look for when designing a game, especially on a mobile device. There were many pro-tips to game design that I haven't noticed before. For example, you should keep in mind that there are UI positions that are either easy, okay, or hard to reach for the user, especially since many people are right handed. This is the reason why many ads or monetization features are located towards the bottom of the screen, where fingers are most likely to press. This is a technique I always saw as a game player myself, but never questioned the intention behind the UI placements.</p>        

        <p>Another thing to keep in mind is instead of creating an 'x' button to exit a pop-up, the author suggests using a close button instead. Psychologically, seeing an 'x' button may make the pop-up look like an annoying piece of information. Having a close button, as well as having a 2-second delay before the exit button appears, helps lead the user to read the information before closing it. This shows just how much intuitive details go into a task flow.</p>

        <p>While game design is not my specialty, it's an area that ties hand in hand with any user application or website interface. It is useful to know these techniques because it helps you pay attention to the technical details that could help a user flow run more smoothly.</p>

        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-30">October 30th, 2023</time>

        <h4>Part One - My Image</h4>
        <p class = question>1. Why and how is this image interesting? Tell us something we would not know by looking at the image alone.</p>

        <p>The image I will be using for my Every Picture project is interesting because it has a cluster of stuffed animals that all look very different. Just looking at the image alone, you would not be able to tell what the story of each stuffed animal is and what makes each one unique. You might also be unsure of what year each one was obtained.</p> 

        
        <p class = question>2. How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection?</p>

        <p>This image relates to my collection because it gives an overview of every single one of my stuffed animals in my current possession.</p>
        
        <p class = question>3. How does your collection or archive say something (i.e. tell a story) about you?</p>

        <p>My stuffed animal collection will be evident of the kind of animals and aesthetics I enjoy. It will show off my interests in cute objects as well as what kind of color palette I like to collect. Lastly, it shows some of my favorite animals as well as the stories of how the plushies are connected to me.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h4>Part Two - Student Image</h4>
        <p class = question>1.What is this image about?</p> 
        

        <p>It seems like this image is about a stuffed animal collection. There is a line-up of several different stuffed animals that all share a similar aesthetic. They all have the same height, fur texture, and similar facial features.
        </p> 
           
        <p class = question>2. What are the most interesting aspects of this image? Describe using some of the language in the introduction to this assignment.</p>
        
        <p>The most interesting aspect of this image is the different variety of animals within the collection. I think the color palette difference in each animal is also unique. The story of the image seems almost linear like a timeline with the stuffed animals placed all in a row.
        </p>


        <p class = question>3. What are the most obvious and the most mysterious aspects of this image?</p>

        <p>The most obvious aspects of the image is that the collection is of stuffed animals and that they are all part of the same manufacturer brand. The only mysterious aspect is the stories of each individual animal and how the student got them.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-23">October 23rd, 2023</time>
        <p>The article, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>, helps encourage readers to practice and develop their visual thinking skills. First you would need to create something that is visually appealing yet leaves viewers curious for more. You should also be practicing regularly by observing pictures without knowing the context and seeing if you can point out the smaller details. It also helps to ask questions and share your thoughts with other peers. This improves self reading and allows more ideas to flow in as you build on others' ideas. Lastly, you can expand your knowledge and start conversations, as well as introduce new ideas.</p>        
        
        <p>A website that inspires visual thinking is <a href= "https://www.awwwards.com/sites/engaged">Engaged</a>. The site uses interactive elements that engage the user into reading what the site has to offer. It utilizes cool effects such as a vortex transition, smooth scrolling, and visual textures across the page. It hooks the viewer in with aesthetically pleasing visuals which then encourages them to read more into the information.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Overlays</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-18">October 18th, 2023</time>

        <p>The article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Overlays</a>, discusses the uses and techniques for modal windows or overlays. I learned that overlays can be used to either show additional information, grab the user's attention, or if you need user input. This is something I never thought about whenever I saw an overlay on a website since it just seemed intuitive. In terms of design characteristics for an overlay, you should always include an escape hatch. This includes a 'cancel' or 'close' button, an escape key, or a feature that allows the user to click out of the window in order to close the overlay. An overlay should also include a title and a main button for submission. What is necessary to consider is the sizing of the overlay, which should be small so that it doesn't take over the whole page, and a focus-feature to highlight the overlay and guide the user's eye.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-12">October 12th, 2023</time>

        <p>The article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, lists a set of guidelines that every product designer should keep in mind when it comes to creating forms. It emphasizes on small details within form layouts that create a big difference for the user experience. For example, characteristics such as type length, text box size, legibility, and coloring all have to be considered when making a form</p>

        <p>One important thing I learned from the article is to reduce cognitive load on a form. This means to simplify any text and visual clutter so that the user does not get overwhelmed with the information on the page. This also takes into account inserting the more simple questions at the beginning of the form and leaving the harder questions for last. If you make the user feel like the form will be too much to work on, then they won't bother filling it out to begin with.</p>
            
        <p>Another thing I thought was useful was keeping any labels or instructions outside of the input fields. Inserting labels within the text fields would only disappear once the user clicks on the box to fill out. This makes it more confusing if the user forgets what they're supposed to be inputting into the form. This is definitely something that I didn't realize would be much of an issue until it was explained to me.</p>

        <p>I think a website that uses efficient form practices is <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/get-started/">Betterhelp</a>. The site provides a smooth questionnaire process by allowing the user to pick from simple options from small lists and checkboxes. The questions also go in the order from from easiest to hardest, which reduces cognitive load.</p>
