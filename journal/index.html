        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-10-12">October 12th, 2023</time>

        <p>The article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, lists a set of guidelines that every product designer should keep in mind when it comes to creating forms. It emphasizes on small details within form layouts that create a big difference for the user experience. For example, characteristics such as type length, text box size, legibility, and coloring all have to be considered when making a form</p>

        <p>One important thing I learned from the article is to reduce cognitive load on a form. This means to simplify any text and visual clutter so that the user does not get overwhelmed with the information on the page. This also takes into account inserting the more simple questions at the beginning of the form and leaving the harder questions for last. If you make the user feel like the form will be too much to work on, then they won't bother filling it out to begin with.</p>
            
        <p>Another thing I thought was useful was keeping any labels or instructions outside of the input fields. Inserting labels within the text fields would only disappear once the user clicks on the box to fill out. This makes it more confusing if the user forgets what they're supposed to be inputting into the form. This is definitely something that I didn't realize would be much of an issue until it was explained to me.</p>

        <p>I think a website that uses efficient form practices is <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/get-started/">Betterhelp</a>. The site provides a smooth questionnaire process by allowing the user to pick from simple options from small lists and checkboxes. The questions also go in the order from from easiest to hardest, which reduces cognitive load.</p>
